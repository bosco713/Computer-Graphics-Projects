# Computer-Graphics-Projects
Welcome to the Computer Graphics Projects repository, which contains four projects that explore various aspects of computer graphics, image manipulation, and animation. Each project presents unique challenges and features, allowing me to apply concepts discussed in the lectures while also tackling more complex tasks. This repository serves as a record storing what my team and I have learnt and done using Visual Studio in HKUST COMP4411: Computer Graphics. 

## Project Structure
Each project has separate requirements and includes advanced features, often referred to as "bells and whistles," which typically involve more intricate coding challenges.

## Project 1: Impressionist
### Overview:
Impressionist is an interactive program that transforms images into impressionistic paintings. Inspired by the work of Paul Haeberli, specifically the "Paint by Numbers" concept, this project allows users to load an existing image and apply a sequence of brush strokes on a blank canvas. These strokes sample colors from the original image, creating a painterly effect.

### Objective:
Enhance a skeleton version of the Impressionist program by implementing functionalities related to image manipulation, OpenGL primitives, user-interface design, and image processing.

## Project 2: Modeler
### Overview:
In this project, my team defines a 3D model and the controls for manipulating it. The skeleton code provides a framework for the user interface and some basic functions for drawing geometric primitives. My team created our model in a separate source file that integrates with the existing codebase.

### Objective:
Utilize OpenGL to design and animate a character of our own creation, gaining familiarity with 3D hierarchical modeling and transformations.

## Project 3: Trace
### Overview:
Trace is a program designed for constructing recursively ray-traced images of relatively simple scenes. This project focuses on applying ray tracing techniques to generate realistic images based on computational algorithms.

## Project 4: Animator
### Overview:
Built on the same architecture as the Modeler, this project allows us to reuse your models. By replacing robotarm.cpp with a functional model file from Project 2, we can compile and interact with the interface. This project includes a dual-window setup: one for the model viewer and another for manipulating model parameters. The exciting addition is the "Curves" mode, enabling users to create and edit time-varying curves for model parameters by adjusting control points.

### Objective:
Extend the spline-based animation system to support multiple curve types and implement a particle system simulation engine. After developing a robust system, We created compelling animations using our program.
