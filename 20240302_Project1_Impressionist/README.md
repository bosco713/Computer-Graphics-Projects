## Reference : [Project 1 : Impressionist](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp4411/Password_Only/projects/impressionist/index.html)

## Sample solution [here](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp4411/Password_Only/projects/impressionist/W2KDemo01.zip)

## Basic Requirements
1. Implement 5 different brush types:
    - [x] Single line
    - [x] Scattered lines
    - [x] Scattered points
    - [x] (Filled) circles
    - [x] Scattered (filled) circles

2. Add sliders to control various brush attributes:
    - [x] Line thickness
    - [x] Brush angle
    - [x] Brush size (existing) (marked as finished as it is given)

3. Add the ability to control the brush direction using:
    - [x] Slider value
    - [x] Right mouse button for drag out direction line
    - [x] Direction of cursor movement
    - [x] Directions perpendicular to the gradient of the image

4. Allow the user to change the opacity (alpha value) of the brush stroke:
    - [x] Alpha value slider in the controls window

## Bonus

1. Add additional brush types:
    - [x] Triangle (give (target.x,target.y) as centroid, draw a equilateral triangle)

2. Clip brush strokes to the painting region as they're being painted:
    - [ ] Implement clipping functionality

3. Show a marker on the original image where painting occurs:
    - [x] Marker appears on original image while painting

4. Add a control to swap contents between painting and original image windows:
    - [x] Implement swap functionality

5. Add controls for image color manipulation:
    - [x] Independent scaling of RGB channels

6. Design a brush for selective filter application:
    - [ ] Describe brush functionality

7. Implement undo feature with at least one level of undo:
    - [ ] Undo functionality added

8. Add ability to dissolve one image into another:
    - [ ] Implement dissolve functionality

9. Add a slider to fade original image beneath brush strokes:
    - [ ] Fade in/out functionality added

10. Implement a "mural" effect to load different images while preserving drawn content:
    - [ ] New Mural Image/Change Mural Image functionality

11. Add "alpha-mapped" brush strokes:
    - [ ] Describe alpha-mapped brush stroke functionality

12. Automatic painting feature with randomized brush strokes:
    - [x] Automatic painting feature added

13. Allow brush strokes to follow gradient of a different image:
    - [ ] Button(s) for automatic brush stroke direction

14. Clip brush strokes to edges in the image:
    - [ ] Edge-clipping functionality added

15. Construct a filter kernel design interface:
    - [ ] Interface for filter kernel design

16. Automatically find edges in the base image:
    - [ ] Edge detection button added

17. Implement multiresolution automatic painting technique:
    - [ ] Describe multiresolution painting technique

18. Design a brush for stretching and pulling the image:
    - [ ] Describe stretch and pull brush functionality

19. Implement a curved brush that follows image gradient:
    - [ ] Curved brush functionality added

20. Create an image mosaic from a source image:
    - [ ] Mosaic image construction implemented

21. Extend Impressionist program to work with video:
    - [ ] Video processing functionality added

22. Implement Bayesian matting:
    - [ ] Bayesian matting functionality added
